# ITI Internship: Final Project
## Beatrice Trinidad
## Rutgers University: Teaching and Learning with Technology
## Spring 2018

This is my Final Project submission in which I created a whole website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did not use any third party content management systems such as Squarespace, Drupal, Wordpress, etc, so that I can showcase one of my goals in creating a website.
