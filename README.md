# ITI Internship: Final Project
Beatrice Trinidad

Rutgers University: Teaching and Learning with Technology, Spring 2018

This is my Final Project submission in which I created a whole website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did not use any third party content management systems such as Squarespace, Drupal, Wordpress, etc. I think a website is most appropriate because it showcases my work while actually implementing what I learned from my internship by creating a website.
