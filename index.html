                    For the Spring of 2018, I had the opportunity to work for Rutgers University's very own Division of Continuing Studies in the Teaching and Learning with Technology department. I had the role of an <strong>application developer intern</strong>, working under the head application developer in the DevOps team.

        <!-- GOALS -->
        <section class="resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex flex-column" id="goals">

            <div class="my-auto">
                <h2 class="mb-5">Goals</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">At the beginning of this semester, I had very technical, measurable goals that that I could reach by the end of my internship. Luckily, these goals I wanted from my internship aligned with things I have been wanting to learn for quite some time. These learning goals are..</p>

                <h3><i class="far fa-dot-circle mr-3"></i>How to work with a framework or an API</h3>

                <p>Frameworks are basically a starting point of items that a developer can use to avoid doing the simple or mundane tasks that come with setting up a website. For instance, every time I create a website (like this one), building the structure of the website can be really tedious and a lot of copy and pasting from my old work. However, there are popular frameworks out there that other people have written, and provide a system for easily building sites in an organized matter. I’ve been wanting to learn how to work with a framework because they’re generally really popular in the programming world, and they’re fully customizable to what you want them to be; you aren’t forced to take them as-is, and you can start with a framework and change up parts. That way, I’m not running around tying together loads of code (that could possible have errors) to make it all. However, the thing with frameworks is that they’re written by <i>someone else</i>, so you’re basically learning about someone else’s items and developed code. This has been holding me back for a while personally as a technical skill. In the past, I’ve tried to learn how to use them but nowadays, frameworks are so customizable that a lot of the time they’re bloated with features and were too complex for me at the time.</p>

                <h3><i class="far fa-dot-circle mr-3"></i>How to create a dynamic website from scratch</h3>

                <p>Although dynamic and static websites may seem the same to the viewer, there’s actually a very big difference between the two behind the screen and in the code. A <b>static website</b> is only composed of front-end programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which is the basic code to designing a website. However, if you wanted to change a word or sentence on a page, you would have to directly edit the HTML file that takes care of that page. On the other hand, a <b>dynamic website</b> is a website that depends on a back-end programming language, such as PHP or C#, that deals with a system in place to manage content and updates (ex. WordPress). It deals with a lot of database technologies, so think of any e-commerce website that needs to have its products and prices constantly updated - it’s dynamic.</p>

                <p>This website is actually a static website - I wrote all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript myself. I’ve been familiar with this for a while, but taking on dynamic websites is a whole other beast. Although I am really familiar with editing and managing content on dynamic content management systems like WordPress, I have never actually built a website on them before because they require a lot of back-end knowledge that I simply didn’t know before this internship. </p>

                <h3><i class="far fa-dot-circle mr-3"></i>To be more familiar with LAMP stack and development</h3>

                <p>Every modern web application is built out of multiple layers; all of these pieces together are called the stack. At the simplest, you have an operating system (ex. Mac, Windows), web server (the software that connects to the internet), a database (where data is stored), and a programming language (ex. Java, Python). An incredibly common stack used is the <b>LAMP stack</b>, which stands for Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (database), and PHP (programming language).</p>

                <p>Being able to develop and code applications with the LAMP stack is so useful because a lot of the internet and its websites are built on it. This concept requires a lot of various knowledge in the technical realm, and I think it is an ambitious process to learn. It’s been my goal for a long time and accompanies creating a dynamic website, because that’s what dynamic websites are mostly built on.</p>

        <!-- PROJECT -->
        <section class="resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex flex-column" id="project">
            <div class="my-auto">
                <h2 class="mb-5">The Major Project</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519397154350-533cea5b8bff?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=009599aa0979619a04f21ec0d5486955&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80">

                <p>Now as an application developer intern, I am responsible for providing web and database application support for development projects and services. Under my supervisor, I was given the ambitious project to be in charge of upgrading our department's website from Drupal 7 to 8 this semester. At first, I was a little worried this assigned project wouldn’t help me towards my goals, but this project actually ended up heavily helping me achieve all three goals due to its extensive process. Still, I thought this project was going to be much easier than I originally thought. I thought I could simply follow the old Drupal 7 code, but there were some major changes in Drupal 8 that I had to learn on my own. After all, upgrading the entire website is not that easy; it’s not as simple as pressing the update button on a software and you’re ready to go. There is a lot of code and problem solving that comes with working with Drupal, since it provides dynamic websites rather than static ones. Again, I'm well-versed in the aesthetics of web design in static websites, but my back-end skills are relatively weaker.</p>

                <p>I was the sole worker on this project while the head application developer just supervised my progress, so this was definitely a challenging - and at times, very stressful - learning opportunity for me since all I had was my supervisor and Google to figure out problems. Although my supervisor provided very basic steps to the process of this project, it was up to me to fill in the details and figure out how to accomplish these steps. Nonetheless, I feel that a lot of great knowledge and work has come from this project due to how much I had to learn myself, and I always do appreciate a challenge - especially in information technology!</p>

                <p>My experience in programming languages and tools certainly multiplied after this internship. I'm honestly astonished at how many programming tools and languages I learned while listing them, and I'm genuinely grateful that I'm coming out with these skills. Even more so, I learned that major projects are too big for one person to do alone, and it's really difficult to succeed without getting some help. Thus, I really gained a sense of communicating with my supervisor about how to do things if I was stuck. There was a handful of instances in the beginning where I was spending too much time on a step, and my supervisor noticed. He actually pointed out that if I'm spending more than 2 hours on something, to immediately come to him. I realized that me being stuck is unproductive for me, him, and the project itself. Thus, if I had to give advice to another intern that pursues IT, I would certainly stress how important it is to take the initiative to learn things on your own, but to not be prideful and ask questions when needed.</p>

                <p>Even more so, being in the coding field consists of a lot of projects, and followign due dates for every step of the process is essential. To be honest, I was never a timely person, but this internship definitely helped me to learn and work more efficiently. While working on these projects, I came to the realization that I am extremely detail-oriented. Although this comes in handy and improves my quality of work, it can actually be detrimental to my time management. There were times were I was too focused on one sub-section when something had to be done with the parent section itself. Thus, this internship definitely taught me how to have a stronger work ethic by being able to prioritize my tasks.</p>
            </div>


            Most projects are too big for one person to do alone, and even if they weren't, nobody wants work done in a vacuum. If they are willing to pay for it, it's work to be done for someone, so at the very least, you'll be regularly interfacing with whoever that person is. Even ignoring that, I think you would be better served in the grand scheme of things prioritizing tackling your inability to deal with other people over finding a job where you are completely solitary. Being introverted is one thing. Being utterly crippled by the mere act of working with other people sounds like you might want to seek out a therapist (and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, don't let anybody tell you otherwise).

                <p>To sum it up, this was a very informative, demanding, yet rewarding internship. I really did enjoy the work I was doing, and I think the best part about it was that I got to see my work in action. It is a humbling experience to see someone use something I did and have a pleasant experience. Furthermore, one aspect that I changed my opinion on is how I felt about the size of the workplace. I’ve always wanted to work in big organizations, but my office is relatively small; actually, my supervisor and I are the only ones who are currently in the DevOps team. In the beginning, I was a little skeptic about the room I had to grow within the organization. Nonetheless, I actually really appreciated working on a small team and for a small department because I got to make major impacts. Getting to spearhead a major project is an opportunity that allowed me to take on the initiative, but it also made me realize that my role as an intern was to learn - not to be an expert from day one. </p>
                
                <p>Ultimately, working closely with my supervisor gave a very accurate look into the software engineering and web development field of IT. Although I gained a lot of knowledge through my time with Teaching and Learning with Technology at Rutgers, the most important thing that I learned about myself is how much satisfaction I gain from making things that are useful to other people. In IT, I love that I am able to be the mediator between technology and people, and programming provides a platform where others can use my work and find it helpful. Honestly, I knew classes from the ITI Curriculum at Rutgers like Web Design and Object-Oriented Programming would come useful in this position, but I was more surprised about how much soft skills I utilized. After all, several ITI classes consist of group projects and presentations, and being able to communicate in a team-setting certainly helped me in this environment. Because technology is constantly changing, especially in programming, there is always an air of fascination and always things to be learned. Overall, I’m glad that this internship confirmed my passion for all the beautiful things that come with programming, and I’m thankful that the internship was an enjoyable experience!</p>
